## MYOG 1
Make Your Own Game - 1
So, I'm going to to make my own app for the first time in my life. Here is the design of the app:
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
So, at the first tab, you'll see a buttons like Login, Logout, about me, Instructions to use.

Login:
So, when we click on login, you'll see 2options.
1) Login as a seller.
2) Login as a user.

And so we login as a user, we will first have to enter our name and mobile number.
Then they will send an OTP to the mobile number(Add or skip)
Then they will confirm whether the mobile number is genuine.
Then the user account will get created.

If we login as a seller, we will have to enter our mobile number and email adress (optional);
Then they will send an OTP to the mobile number and email adress to confirm;
Then if it is confirmed, the account'll get created.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

USER:
Toolbars: Contact the sellers
          Logout
          Change contact details
          Rate the seller.

Contact the SELLERS: They will see a list of Sellers, and in front oftheir names will be their contact details.
Then the users can contact them, or even there will be a button of send message.

When they click on that button, the SELLERS will get a message or an email with a google map location and the contact details of the person who opted for them.

Then there will be a form, where the user has to enter how much the approx. weight of the RADDI is, and they can even take a pic of the RADDI and upload it to the 
form.

SELLERS: Search for users who requested for them.
         Rate the user.
         Contact the company.
         Logout.

Search for users: Different users, their average rating, and their contact details.
Rate previous users: There the will see the previous users they have served but have not rated.
Then they will see an option of rate user
They will see 5 stars, and they have to click on any star to that.

Contact the Company: They will see a message, or a button with the mobile number and the official e-mail of the company.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
There will also be moderators:
They can warn the seller account or the user account.
After 15 warns, they will block the account.
There will be a 403 forbidden website for users and sellers. Only allowed IP adresses can access that website.
